Second homework

When I built my grid for the "index" page it was pretty easy, once I got the hang out the 
grid layout.  I think I have a good understand the structure but I was not able to figure 
out the responsiveness of my own grid. 

Bootstrap made it very easy to design responsive web pages.  I am not an expert on all of 
the different sizes of columns, but I think I understand more about the breakpoints for 
different widths.  

One thing that was easier to do in Bootstrap was making a spacer column.  I ended up putting 
an empty <p> when other empty containers were not spacing properly.
